Pillarbox is an easy-to-use, object-based FIFO queue with support for iOS, tvOS and macOS. Addition and removal is an O(1) operation. Writes are synchronous; data will be written to the disk before an operation returns.

## Installation

Pillarbox is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) which is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system and automates the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Pillarbox as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/aplr/Pillarbox.git",
        .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")
    )
]
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available [here](https://pillarbox.aplr.io) and provides a comprehensive documentation of the library's public interface. Expect usage examples and guides to be added shortly.
